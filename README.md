# Crypteron + DocumentDB = rapid development of highly secure cloud apps

This is a quick demo showing how to use Crypteron CipherObject to secure data in DocumentDB. Enabling pervasive encryption with just a couple of lines of code, Crypteronâ€™s Security Framework transparently handles all aspects of privacy, tamper protection, secure key distribution, secure key storage, access controls, audit logs, key revocations, key rotations and more. The NuGet package is `Crypteron.CipherObject`.

Observe the `GeneticCondition` field when you run this sample app. Before deleting the database at the end, compare the console output with the at-rest storage data (e.g. via portal.azure.com => DocumentDB => Document Explorer). Other than your own code, everyone else only sees strongly encrypted data.

### Only top level fields and properties are secured 

If you have `thisObject.SSN`, Crypteron.CipherObject.Seal(thisObject) will suffice. But if you have `thisObject.Child.SSN` it won't. You can however use `Crypteron.CipherObject.Seal(thisObject.Child)` instead. 

### `JObject` type is not supported

If writing objects of type `T` (which contains `Secure` properties), when reading them back they should also be of the same type `T`. Return type of `JObject` is currently not supported for decryption of secured values. This means instead of `client.CreateDocumentQuery(...)` one should use something like `client.CreateDocumentQuery<Family>(...)` before `Unseal`ing the result objects.
